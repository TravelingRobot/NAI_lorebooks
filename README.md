A collection of my [NovelAI](https://novelai.net/) (NAI)forebooks. Currently there is only one:

# [The Descriptor](the_descriptor)

## Warning

**The General Descriptor of this lorebook is _no longer recommended_**.

I did 320  blind ratings to see if the "General Descriptor" from this lorebook really improves things for Euterpe or Krake. Turns out it doesn't. For neither model. Any effect I thought I saw was likely just confirmation bias. A report about my research on this is in the works...

Just use `Description of <thing>` without this lorebook it will work just as well (method described [here](https://naidb.miraheze.org/wiki/Directing_the_Narrative)).

Btw: `Summary:` works about as well if you prefer that.

The sense descriptors might or might not have a positive effect. I have not systematically tested them yet.

## Original Description

A simple tool to enhance the use of `Description of ... :`. (Slight re-edit of work from Magenta.Darkstar )

The General Descriptor is based on "Summaries, Sentiments, and Scenes" lorebook by Magenta.Darkstar. It isa very slight edit of the "Summary" entry from the that lorebook. Therefore, most credit has to go to Magenta.Darkstar for this one. I use this to get descriptions of characters, places, and events. Or to set up new scenes. I recommend deleting the `Description of ...:` line after you are done generating a description.

Research on using "Description of thing:" comes from [placebomancer](https://naidb.miraheze.org/wiki/Directing_the_Narrative).

I added experimental entries to get sensory descriptions for v1_2. No guarantees that they actually work, but feel free to try!
